# Welcome to Jammming

Jammming is a React-web-app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## About this project

This project was a Practice Project from the Codecademy Career Path to Front-End Engineer. It was definitely a very challenging project, but I greatly enjoyed building this app, and even continued building new features and restructuring the code after the assignment was 'completed'.

### Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS. 
The main purpose of this project was to learn how to build a React-app using React components, passing state, and making HTTP-requests to the Spotify API

### What I added

I added the album pictures to the tracks shown.

### What I want to add

I would like to be able to see my already existing playlists and add or remove tracks form the selected playlist. This will involve making another request to retrieve the playlist

### What I want to (try to) refactor:

This project was built making use of Class Components. However, a week later I learned what functional components are. I think rewriting the components to functions instead of classes will make for more concise code, giving some nice opportunities to practice hooks and effects, as well as being a nice challenge for me.
