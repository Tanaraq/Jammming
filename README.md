# Welcome to Jammming

Jammming is a React-web-app that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

## About this project

This project was a Practice Project from the Codecademy Career Path to Front-End Engineer. It was definitely a very challenging project, but I greatly enjoyed building this app, and even continued building new features and restructuring the code after the assignment was 'completed'.

### Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React JS. 
The main purpose of this project was to learn how to build a React-app using React components, passing state, and making HTTP-requests to the Spotify API

### What I added

I added the album pictures to the tracks shown.

### What I want to add

I would like to be able to see any already-existing playlists and then add or remove tracks from the selected playlist. This will involve making another request to retrieve the playlist, displaying those, and selecting to which playlist to add the tracks. 

### What I want to (try to) refactor:

This project was built making use of Class Components. However, a week later I learned what functional components are. I think rewriting the components to functions instead of classes will make for more concise code, as well as being a nice challenge for me.
